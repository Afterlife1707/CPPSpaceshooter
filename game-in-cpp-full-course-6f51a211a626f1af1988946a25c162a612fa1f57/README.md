I'm working on this project created by https://github.com/meemknight aka Low Level Game Dev on youtube, as this repo https://github.com/meemknight/game-in-cpp-full-course
in order to work on my c++ skills, and how to make a game without a game engine in c++.
I'm adding my own stuff to it and will be committing regularly.
